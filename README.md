Hey there!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I made a python file to simulate a mini-pandemic using a fewparameters:
- Inhabitants N
- Beta as infection rate
- Gamma as recovery rate
- Suceptible S
- Exposed/incubation time E
- Infected I
- Recovered R
- Dead D
- Mortality as natural death rate
- Mortality_V as virus death rate
- Birth as birth rate
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The simulation goes on for 365 days from day 0 in a village of 100 people.
Steps is used for x and yticks for the graph, so that the scale shows a certain interval of numbers.
if random.random() marks the situation, where new people come into the village.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What if there was a vaccination ready 50 days after the Black Death started to cause havoc?
