## What if there was a vaccination ready 50 days after the Black Death started to cause havoc?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I made a python file to simulate a mini-pandemic using a few parameters:
- Inhabitants __N__
- Infection rate as __BETA__
- Recovery rate as __GAMMA__
- Suceptible __S__
- Exposed/incubation time __E__
- Infected __I__
- Recovered __R__
- Dead __D__
- Natural death rate as __MORTALITY__
- Virus death rate as **MORTALITY_V**
- Birth rate as __BIRTH__
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The simulation goes on for 365 days from day 0 in a village of 100 people.
Steps is used for x and yticks for the graph, so that the scale shows a certain interval of numbers.
if random.random() marks the situation, where new people come into the village.
